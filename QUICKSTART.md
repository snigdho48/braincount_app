## 🚀 Running the App

### Option 1: Run on Android Emulator/Device

```bash
flutter run
```

### Option 2: Build APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

The APK will be in: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## 📸 Camera Features

### How Task Submission Works:

1. User navigates to a pending task
2. Clicks "Submit Task"
3. Opens Task Submission page
4. Selects billboard conditions from checklist
5. **Takes photos using back camera** (4 max)
6. Photos are automatically converted to base64
7. Submits all data to API

### Camera Implementation:

```dart
// Camera automatically uses BACK CAMERA
final base64Image = await CameraService.takePhotoFromBackCamera();

// Images stored as base64 strings
class SubmissionImage {
  final String base64Data;  // Ready for API
  final String fileName;
  final int fileSize;
}
```

## 🔑 Test Login

The app uses mock data for demonstration:

- **Email**: test@example.com (or any email)
- **Password**: 123456 (or any 6+ chars)

All API calls are mocked and will work offline!

## 🛠️ Next Steps (For Production)

### 1. Connect to Real Backend

Edit `lib/app/data/services/api_service.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://your-api-url.com/api';
```

Then uncomment the real API calls and remove mock responses.

### 2. API Request Format

Your backend should accept this JSON format for task submissions:

```json
{
  "task_id": "01",
  "conditions": ["Color Faded", "Medium Damaged"],
  "notes": "Optional notes",
  "images": [
    {
      "base64_data": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ...",
      "file_name": "Picture1",
      "file_size": 102400,
      "status": "completed"
    }
  ],
  "submitted_at": "2025-10-09T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Add Real Google Sign-In

The structure is ready. Just add your Google Sign-In credentials in:
- Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
- iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

### 4. Testing on Real Device

Make sure to:
- Grant camera permissions
- Enable location (for billboard geo-tagging if needed)
- Test image upload with real backend

## 📱 Permissions Already Configured

### Android (✅ Already Added)
- CAMERA
- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- INTERNET

### iOS (Add to Info.plist if building for iOS)
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need camera access to capture billboard photos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need photo library access</string>
```

## 🎯 Key Highlights

1. ✅ **GetX CLI Structure** - Properly organized with bindings, controllers, views
2. ✅ **Back Camera Default** - Always uses rear camera for task photos
3. ✅ **Base64 Images** - All images handled as base64 strings
4. ✅ **Beautiful UI** - Matches your design mockups
5. ✅ **Animated Loader** - Brain-themed spinner (thematically relevant!)
6. ✅ **Full Navigation** - All pages connected with routes
7. ✅ **Error Handling** - Error and success modals
8. ✅ **Offline First** - Works with mock data for testing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues?
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Camera Not Working?
- Check device permissions in Settings
- Ensure AndroidManifest.xml has camera permissions (✅ already added)

### Images Not Showing?
- Images are base64 encoded
- Check `CameraService` if you need to adjust quality

## 📞 Support

All code is well-commented and follows Flutter best practices. Each module is independent and easy to modify.
